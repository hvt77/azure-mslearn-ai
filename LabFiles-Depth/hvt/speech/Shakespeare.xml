    All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players:
    <break time="1s" />
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages.

    This wide and universal theatre
    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
    Wherein we play in.
